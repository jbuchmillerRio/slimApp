## Project
 1. Read and store the data in the files in the "startingData" directory into a MySQL database (you will have to design and create the database).
 2. Develop a RESTful API to display, create, and update and delete locations and personnel.
   * The api display should allow filtering to get location.
   * Build an object oriented solutions.
   * Add a simple front end for bonus points.
   * Completeness counts. Don't forget the stuff you would do for a normal project (like tests and formatting).
